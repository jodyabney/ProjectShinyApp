### Personal Insights Gained
By using the Personal Fitbit Explorer, I learned the following about my own walking exercise patterns and results:

* I've been walking more in general since purchasing the Fitbit and tracking my steps each day as evidenced by the trend line on the `Overview of Steps` chart.
    * Reinforces the old idea of _"What gets measured gets done."_
* I walk more on weekdays than weekends as evidenced when reviewing the data by Day of Week
    * _Potential app enchancement is to allow filtering or facet plotting by Weekday vs Weekend_
* Generally, I walk less on Sundays than Saturdays
* I walk more when I travel on business as I looked back through my personal calendar for business travel dates and compared the number of steps for certain dates using the `Line Chart` by filtering on `Year`.
    * _Potential app enhancement could be allowing the user to catalog travel periods to allow direct analysis in the app._
* **Best of all, I've lost ~30 lbs since I've been working at increasing my activity levels such as number of steps per day!** 
    * _Potential app enchancement could the option to enter personal weight information or collecting weight information if the user has the data available via Fitbit or an alternative source._
